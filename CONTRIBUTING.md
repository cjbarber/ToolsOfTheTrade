## Content

For additions, check that it hasn't been submitted already and that it is suitable for this list.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.

2. Start editing!
  - Additions should be added to the bottom of the section.
  - Please follow the [Addition format](#addition-format).
  - **If you are adding a tool you are affiliated with please include other improvements/fixes to the repo.**
  - Ideally the tool should be hosted, however self-hosted tools are acceptable too.
  - The product/service should have had some coverage on Hacker News - whether this be comments or posts.
  - Descriptions should be concise, descriptive and not marketing-focused.
  - Avoid links appended with `/en`, `gb` etc. so that the link will redirect to the user's own language/location.

3. Commit & [push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) your changes to a new branch.

4. Once you're happy with your changes, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
  - If you're adding something new explain briefly why it's awesome. :sunglasses:
