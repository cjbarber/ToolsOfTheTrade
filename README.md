# HN Tools of The Trade, 2014 Edition

#### Background

In 2010, Joshua Schachter, the founder of Delicious, [posted the following](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910) on Hacker News:

> When I first started delicious, we had to host most of the services ourselves. CVS, mail, mailing lists, etc etc etc.
> These days, lots of that stuff is available as SaaS. What are the tools and services people use instead of hosting their own?
> | I'm not talking about actual production services like EC2 and Heroku and whatnot. We can go over this in another thread.

In 2013, Sharjeel Qureshi, [posted the following](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235137):

> Few years ago, Joshua Schachter started this thread on HN for discussing hosted useful services: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910
> The contribution in thread introduced many interesting SaaS services which can immensely help in deploying services as well as development.
> It's been three years since then. What do we have today?

Many thanks to the big contributors to the previous threads, including garrettdimon, espeed, netshade, and cmadan, and many more that I haven't named.
