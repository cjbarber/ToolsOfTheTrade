**If you are adding a tool you are affiliated with please include other improvements/fixes to the repo.**

If you're adding something new, make sure that it is [formatted correctly](#list-format) and be sure to explain why it is awesome. ðŸ˜Ž

* Ideally the tool should be hosted, however self-hosted tools are acceptable too.
* The product/service should have had some coverage on Hacker News - whether this be comments or posts.
* Descriptions should be concise, descriptive and not marketing-focused.
* Avoid links appended with `/en`, `gb` etc. so that the link will redirect to the user's own language/location.

## List Format

```
| [Example](https://example.com) | [@example](https://twitter.com/example) | Free or $5/user/mo | An example tool used for example purposes `Tag` |
