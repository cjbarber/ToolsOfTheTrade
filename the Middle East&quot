      <title>Forget Bubble Talk -- Beirut Tech Is Accelerating</title>
      <description>Recently called &quot;the Silicon Valley of the Middle East&quot; by CNN, and &quot;the Middle East’s Tech Hub&quot; by TechCrunch, Beirut’s tech scene is the darling of international media of late. (Though Techonomy first wrote about it over two years ago.) The tech scene here has turned a corner, going from fledgling to now officially on the map. Among the reasons: the launch of various funds that will bring over $100 million in investments to Lebanon’s startup economy over the next five years, and the ongoing efforts of Lebanon’s Central Bank to decrease the risk of investing in startups. But now three new companies that specifically aim to foster tech startups are setting up. Two of them are accelerators, and one will invest and nurture slightly more mature companies. In a city of 2.2 million, some are wondering, is this a bubble? And if so, when will it burst?</description>

      <title>Play With Fire(walls) And Get Burned: A Future Without Firewalls</title>
      <description>Plato tells of the ancient city of Atlantis, full of advanced technology and feats of engineering such as the world will never see again. The Atlanteans built great walls of exotic metals, striving to conquer the very ocean itself. But they were unable to stem the tide and the angry gods sank Atlantis and all its wonders to the bottom of the ocean.</description>
